	<h1>Bio </h1>
	<p> I am an assistant professor at Lafayette College in the 
		<a href="https://math.lafayette.edu/" target ="_blank"><u>Mathematics Department</u></a>.  
		My research focus is in the fields of applied linear algebra, applied numerical analysis, 
		and scientific computing. I earned my PhD in math from Virginia Tech in 2021, a BS (2012)
		and MS (2015) in math with a minor in computer science from VT, and a BA (2008) in sociology 
		with a minor in education from Roanoke College. I am an expert in iterative methods for solving 
		large linear systems and eigenproblems. In particular, I work with Krylov subspace methods and 
		preconditioning techniques to develop novel and innovative algorithms that achieve efficient 
		and accurate solutions to important problems in a wide range of fields 
		in science and engineering. Recently, I have extended this to applications arising in emerging 
		and novel technologies such as quantum computing and machine learning. I am also an experienced 
		educator with over ten years teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics and 
		computer science. Having previously taught middle and high school mathematics, I retain a deep 
		understanding and appreciation for cultivating strong foundational skills in STEM fields and 
		incorporate pedagogical approaches in my collegiate classrooms that build on techniques learned 
		when teaching at the secondary level. I have a strong passion for promoting the success of 
		underrepresented people in different fields, particularly for women in traditionally male fields 
		such as applied mathematics. I dedicate my professional service to efforts that
		directly address this lack of representation, drawing on my experience studying and 
		researching gender roles in the workplace in my undergraduate studies.</p>

	<h1> Call for Undergraduate Researchers </h1>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Undergraduate students, are you looking for research opportunities?</b> Research affords you the opportunity to learn outside of the constraints of a course, or textbook, or homework assignment.  It provides you with valuable experience that ultimately supports a wide range of careers in both academia and industry. For those of you with ambition to pursue graduate study, undergradaute reserach allows you to experience the rigors -- and joys -- of academic research, while also augmenting your dossier meaningfully and competitively when applying to schools. I have openings every semester for undergraduate research. In all cases, credit can be offered for work completed.  In exceptional cases, students may earn a competitive stipend. Please navigate to my <a href="./Research.html"><u>Research</u></a> page for a description of current projects, and my <a href="./Papers.html"><u>Papers</u></a> page for a list of current and past students' projects. If you are interested in working with me, reach out as soon as possible to ensure full consideration for a spot for the semester. <em>I do not currently have any active openings for the Fall 2025 semester while I am on leave, but I will to begin recruiting students in the Spring 2026 semester to start projects as early as Fall 2026.</em>
